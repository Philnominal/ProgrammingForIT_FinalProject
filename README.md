# ProgrammingForIT_FinalProject
Final Project for my Programming for IT course, a basic DnD character creation application.

Long Description:
  I am looking to create a DnD character creation application. This will generate a set of numbers to use as ability scores. You will then be able to assign them to specific attributes of STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, and CHA. You will input a name, choose a race, which will apply appropriate modifiers to the ability scores, a class, and determine what level it will be. You will then be able to save/and or print the created character to a document or printer. This will have a GUI to help facilitate all of this for the user.
